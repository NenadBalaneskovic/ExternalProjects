# GAN vs OpenCV Chessboard Reconstruction

## üìå Project Overview  

This project aims to compare traditional **OpenCV-based** methods for chessboard image reconstruction with
**Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-driven** approaches. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of deep learning 
in reconstructing **secluded or obscured chessboard sections** more accurately than conventional techniques 
(see [References](https://github.com/NenadBalaneskovic/ExternalProjects/blob/main/LLM_GAN_ImageReconstruction/README.md#-references) 1 - 3 below).

## üöÄ Features  

- **OpenCV Reconstruction**: Uses contour detection and perspective transformation to restore missing parts.
- **GAN-Based Reconstruction**: Trained with a dataset of **chessboard images** to generate missing squares using adversarial learning.

## üìä Methodology  

1. **Preprocessing**: Chessboard images are converted to grayscale and normalized.
2. **OpenCV Approach**:
   - Detects edges using `cv2.Canny()`.
   - Identifies missing squares through contour detection.
   - Attempts reconstruction using transformations.
3. **GAN Approach**:
   - Uses a **trained generator** to recreate missing squares.
   - Fine-tunes output through **loss function optimization**.
   - Adjusts resolution dynamically with `cv2.resize()`.

## üî¨ Comparison Goals  

- **Accuracy of square reconstruction** in obstructed images.
- **Performance on tilted chessboards** vs. frontal views (future implementation).
- **Processing speed and computational efficiency**.

## üöÄ Results  

‚úî GAN trainings have been performed via Google Colabs free access to a T4 GPU for  

1. 5000 epochs, batch size of 64 and 200 chessboard images (duration 2h),  
2. 10000 epochs, batch size of 32 and 200 chessboard images (duration 5 - 6 hours).  

‚úî After 10000 epochs for batch sizes 32 the GAN model was capable of draving an (8x8) rectangular boundary around the 
originally secluded (8x7) portion of the chessboard and reconstructing its rectangles
(the last 8th row is the missing corrected chessboard portion).  
   
## üõ† How to Run (in Google Colab)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open Google Colab  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to Google Colab  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Click "New Notebook" to create a fresh environment  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable GPU for Faster Training  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Runtime" ‚Üí "Change runtime type"  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Select "GPU" from the dropdown  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Save"

‚úî This ensures your GAN training runs on GPU, making it much faster.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Your Training Script  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Inside Google Colab, go to "Files" (left sidebar)  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Click "Upload" and add:

-- the GAN training script (train_gan.py)

-- the chessboard dataset (dataset/secluded/ & dataset/complete/)  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
!pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run Reconstruction  

1Ô∏è‚É£. Run a GAN Training (specify number of stochastic gradient descent epochs and batch size)  

2Ô∏è‚É£  Load our script and start training:  
```python
!python train_gan.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£  Download the h5 model file ("gan_chessboard_model.h5"):
1Ô∏è‚É£. Once training is complete, save the trained GAN model:  
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import save_model

generator.save("/content/gan_chessboard_model.h5")  # Save model in Colab
```  

2Ô∏è‚É£  Then download it manually by clicking the file in the Colab sidebar. 

## üìà Future Improvements  
‚úî **Future improvements may involve the following aspects**:

1. Enhanced GAN training with more diverse chessboard perspectives.

2. Incorporation of object detection models for robust missing square identification.

3. Optimized processing speed using GPU acceleration.

4. Tilted & Obscured Image Handling: Perspective correction improves the accuracy of chessboard restoration from angled views.
