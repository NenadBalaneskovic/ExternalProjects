# B üìñ Theoretical Introduction to Advanced Signal Denoising

## üèóÔ∏è 1. Introduction  
Noise contamination is a critical issue in **signal processing**, leading to distortions and reduced accuracy in measured data. The need for
**adaptive and hybrid noise reduction methods** has driven research into robust techniques. This project explores various **multi-modal denoising approaches**,
integrating **variance estimation, correlation-based filtering, and adaptive resampling** for enhanced noise suppression.

## üî¨ 2. Noise Variance Estimation  

### üîπ 2.1 Median-Filtered Variance Estimation  
Noise variance estimation is essential for effective denoising. One method involves applying a **median filter** to smooth signal variations while estimating 
noise levels dynamically. The variance \( \sigma^2 \) is computed as:



$$
\[
\sigma^2 = \text{median}(|x_i - \text{median}(x)|)
\]
$$



where $$\( x_i \)$$ represents local signal samples.

**Distribution-Specific Adjustments**:

| **Noise Type**  | **Variance Adjustment Formula** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Gaussian Noise**  | $$\( \sigma^2_{\text{adj}} = 0.8 \cdot \sigma^2 \)$$ |
| **Uniform Noise**   | $$\( \sigma^2_{\text{adj}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2 \)$$ |
| **Laplace Noise**   | $$\( \sigma^2_{\text{adj}} = 2 \cdot \sigma^2 \)$$ |

where $$\( \mu \)$$ is the signal mean and $$\( N \)$$ is the number of samples.

### üîπ 2.2 Correlation-Based Noise Variance Estimation  
Another approach uses **autocorrelation properties** to estimate noise variance dynamically:


$$
\[
\sigma^2_{\text{corr}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=1}^{M} \text{ACF}(k)
\]
$$



where $$\( \text{ACF}(k) \)$$ represents the autocorrelation function at lag $$\( k \)$$, and $$\( M \)$$ is the number of lags used.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Adaptive Noise Variance Estimation  

### üîÑ 3.1 Dynamic Noise Variance Estimation  
To enhance robustness in **non-stationary noise environments**, a **real-time complexity analysis** adapts variance estimation:


$$
\[
\sigma^2_{\text{dyn}} = \alpha \cdot \sigma^2_{\text{median}} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \sigma^2_{\text{corr}}
\]
$$



where $$\( \alpha \)$$ is an adaptive weighting factor dependent on **local signal complexity**.

### üé≠ 3.2 Hybrid Variance Estimation Framework  
A hybrid approach combining **median-filtered** and **correlation-based variance estimation** offers greater adaptability:


$$
\[
\sigma^2_{\text{hybrid}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sigma^2_{\text{median}} + \sigma^2_{\text{corr}} \right)
\]
$$



This framework optimally adjusts for diverse **multi-modal noise distributions**.

## üöÄ 4. Advanced Hybrid Signal Denoising  

### üìä 4.1 Multi-Stage Adaptive Filtering  
By integrating multiple filtering stages, signal integrity is preserved while enhancing noise suppression. A **dynamic kernel adjustment** is employed:


$$
\[
K_{\text{opt}} = K_{\text{min}} + (K_{\text{max}} - K_{\text{min}}) \left( 1 - \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{local}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{max}}} \right)
\]
$$



where $$\( K_{\text{opt}} \)$$ is the optimal kernel size, dynamically tuned based on local **noise variance $$\( \sigma^2_{\text{local}} \)$$**.

### üîó 4.2 Hybrid Statistical Noise Reduction  
Combining **correlation-based denoising** and **adaptive variance estimation**, this technique enhances **adaptability**:


$$
\[
x_{\text{filtered}} = \beta \cdot x_{\text{median}} + (1-\beta) \cdot x_{\text{corr}}
\]
$$



where $$\( \beta \)$$ adapts to signal **complexity levels**.

## üîÑ 5. Real-Time Adaptive Noise Suppression  

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5.1 Dynamic Fusion of Denoising Techniques  
An **adaptive weighting mechanism** selects optimal noise suppression strategies dynamically:


$$
\[
x_{\text{fusion}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \omega_i \cdot x_{\text{denoised}, i}
\]
$$



where $$\( \omega_i \)$$ is the fusion weight and $$\( x_{\text{denoised}, i} \)$$ represents denoised signals from various methods.

### üîÄ 5.2 Multi-Stage Hybrid Filtering  
This method integrates **variance estimation, correlation-based denoising, and adaptive resampling** into a **multi-step framework**:


$$
\[
x_{\text{final}} = \lambda_1 \cdot x_{\text{median}} + \lambda_2 \cdot x_{\text{corr}} + \lambda_3 \cdot x_{\text{adaptive}}
\]
$$



where $$\( \lambda_i \)$$ are **adaptive fusion parameters**.

### üéØ 5.3 Optimized Signal Reconstruction  
Final reconstruction includes **error correction mechanisms**:


$$
\[
x_{\text{corrected}} = x_{\text{final}} - \gamma \cdot \text{Error}(x_{\text{final}})
\]
$$



where $$\( \gamma \)$$ scales the correction factor based on residual noise levels.

## üèÅ 6. Conclusion  
This **adaptive signal denoising framework** integrates **variance estimation, multi-stage filtering, and fusion-based noise suppression** 
to achieve **robust and efficient noise reduction**. The incorporation of **real-time adaptability** ensures that signals retain essential properties while effectively mitigating noise distortions.

# C Implementation Details of the Denoising Framework  

## 1. Introduction  
This document describes the implementation details of the **ensemble-based denoising framework**, outlining the individual functions, their integration, and the rationale behind their design.

The project employs **multiple noise mitigation techniques**, with an emphasis on **adaptive and hybrid approaches** that do not rely on deep learning.
The goal is to refine and optimize **non-deep-learning denoising strategies**, selecting the most **flexible and effective noise suppression method** based on real-time signal properties.

## 2. Functions and Their Implementation  

### **2.1 Hybrid Multi-Pass Adaptive Median Filtering**  

#### **Purpose:**  
Designed to **smooth signals while preserving edges**, this technique applies an **adaptive median filter** over multiple passes.

#### **Implementation Overview:**  
- Computes **local complexity** by evaluating **short-term variations** around each sample.
- Dynamically selects a **median filter kernel size** based on local signal behavior.
- Applies **multi-pass processing** to iteratively refine noise suppression.
- Implements **hybrid smoothing**, where the new signal is blended with the previous signal using an **adjustable weighting factor** \( \alpha \).

#### **Mathematical Formulation:**  
Given a **signal $$\( x \)$$** of length $$\( N \)$$, the local complexity at position $$\( i \)$$ is defined as:


$$
\[
C_i = \left| x_i - \frac{1}{L} \sum_{k=i-5}^{i+5} x_k \right|
\]
$$



where $$\( L \)$$ is the local window size.

The kernel size is then dynamically adjusted:


$$
\[
K_i = K_{\min} + (K_{\max} - K_{\min}) \left( 1 - \frac{C_i}{\max(C)} \right)
\]
$$



Ensuring **odd-sized kernels** prevents artifacts in filtering:


$$
\[
K_i = K_i + 1 \quad \text{(if \( K_i \) is even)}
\]
$$



Each pass refines the signal $$\( x \)$$, blending the filtered version:


$$
\[
x_{\text{filtered}} = \alpha x_{\text{median}} + (1 - \alpha) x_{\text{original}}
\]
$$



---

### **2.2 Enhanced Correlation-Based Noise Reduction**  

#### **Purpose:**  
Leverages **autocorrelation properties** to estimate and mitigate noise dynamically.

#### **Implementation Overview:**  
- Computes the **autocorrelation function (ACF)** to analyze periodic dependencies in the signal.
- Estimates noise levels by averaging the **second half of the ACF spectrum**.
- Applies an **adaptive correction factor**, ensuring **optimal noise reduction** without distorting the primary waveform.

#### **Mathematical Formulation:**  


$$
\[
\text{ACF}(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{N-k} x_i \cdot x_{i+k}
\]
$$



Noise estimation:


$$
\[
\sigma_{\text{noise}} = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=M/2}^{M} \text{ACF}(k)
\]
$$



Corrected signal:


$$
\[
x_{\text{corrected}} = x - (\sigma_{\text{noise}} \cdot \text{Correction Factor})
\]
$$

- Computes **local noise levels** using **standard deviation-based analysis**.
- Applies **adaptive Œ≤-scaling** to suppress noise dynamically.
- Fine-tunes resampling parameters to ensure a balance between **noise removal** and **signal preservation**.

#### **Mathematical Formulation:**  

Noise level estimation:


$$
\[
\sigma_{\text{local}, i} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{L} \sum_{k=i-10}^{i+10} (x_k - \mu)^2}
\]
$$



Adaptive Œ≤-scaling:


$$
\[
\beta_i = \beta_0 \left( 1 - \exp\left(- \frac{\sigma_{\text{local}, i}}{\max(\sigma_{\text{local}})} \right) \right) + \text{Offset}
\]
$$



Resampled signal:


$$
\[
x_{\text{resampled}, i} = (1 - \beta_i) x_i + \beta_i \cdot \text{Local Mean}
\]
$$

### **2.4 Hybrid Correlated Beta-Sigma Denoiser**  

#### **Purpose:**  
Combines **correlation-based denoising** and **Œ≤œÉ-resampling** to achieve an **adaptive hybrid denoiser**.

#### **Implementation Overview:**  
- Applies **correlation-based filtering** for periodic noise removal.
- Implements **adaptive Œ≤œÉ-resampling** to smooth residual noise.
- Integrates both methods into a **single hybrid strategy**, dynamically blending them.

#### **Mathematical Formulation:**  


$$
\[
x_{\text{hybrid}} = \alpha \cdot x_{\text{corr}} + (1-\alpha) \cdot x_{\text{resampled}}
\]
$$



where $$\( \alpha \)$$ controls the weighting.

---

### **2.5 Flexible Dynamic Denoiser**  

#### **Purpose:**  
Designed to **adaptively select** the best noise mitigation strategy **based on real-time signal characteristics**.

#### **Implementation Overview:**  
- Evaluates **local signal complexity and noise intensity**.
- Dynamically assigns **fusion weights** for each technique.
- Integrates all previously defined methods into a **flexible, ensemble-based framework**.

#### **Mathematical Formulation:**  

Local noise estimation:


$$
\[
\sigma_{\text{noise}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( x_i - \mu \right)^2
\]
$$



Fusion weighting:


$$
\[
\alpha_{\text{fusion}} = \min(1.0, \max(0.3, (1 - \sigma_{\text{noise}}) \cdot (1 - \text{Complexity Factor})))
\]
$$



Final adaptive signal:


$$
\[
x_{\text{flexible}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \alpha_{\text{fusion}} \cdot x_{\text{median}} + (1-\alpha_{\text{fusion}}) \cdot x_{\text{corr}} + 0.5 x_{\text{resampled}} + 0.5 x_{\text{hybrid}} \right)
\]
$$

| `duration`     | Total length of the signal (seconds). |
| `sampling_rate`| Number of samples per second. |
| `noise_std`    | Standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the signal. |

### **3.2 Signal Generation Process**  

#### **Step 1: Time Vector Creation**  
The function first **constructs the time vector** with evenly spaced samples:

- **Sawtooth wave** ‚Üí Linearly increasing ramp signal.
- **Gaussian noise** ‚Üí Random normally distributed values.

#### **Step 3: Noise Addition**  
To simulate realistic conditions, **Gaussian noise** is applied:


$$
\[

\]
$$



where $$\( \mathcal{N}(0, \text{noise_std}) \)$$ represents a **zero-mean normal distribution**.

#### **Step 4: Return Values**
