# Real Estate Data Set Analysis in Flower Hill

## üìå Project Overview
This project involves a large data set related to real estate sales for a fictional town of Flower Hill. The aim is to combine the analysis of this data set with PyMongo,
MLflow, Python (SARIMAX times series forecasting, classification, Neural Networks, Kohonen Maps) and DAG-like process organization of ML-tasks.
Thus, we are blending data engineering, machine learning, forecasting, and process automation into a well-structured framework
(see [References](https://github.com/NenadBalaneskovic/ExternalProjects/tree/main/RealEstateAnalysis#-references) 1 - 3 below).

## üìú Flower Hill's Story
Flower Hill is a flourishing City, consisting of 7 districts: Costal, Central, Mercantil, Faunarium, Technica, Academia and Historica. 
Costal department contains usually high valued real estate items, such as villas, luxury appartments, etc. 
Central is the center of the city consisting mostly of offices. Mercantil revolves around the Stock Exchange of the City. 
Faunarium contains parks, lakes and real estate item connected with them. Technica contains technology companies, Academia district is 
centered around the Flower University of Technology, whereas Historica represents a traditional, historical real estate district. 
The City dates back almost 200 years and we could try to create a data set of real estate purchases from 1900 till 2025.

### **üõ† Conceptual Framework**
Here‚Äôs how we can approach this project step by step:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structure & Storage** (PyMongo)  
‚úî Define the schema for real estate transactions (prices, timestamps, property types, etc.).  
‚úî Optimize indexing in **MongoDB** for fast querying and aggregation.  
‚úî Use **historical data pipelines** to preprocess sales trends.  

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Strategy** (MLflow for Tracking)  
‚úî **SARIMAX** ‚Üí Time series forecasting for predicting real estate trends in Flower Hill.  
‚úî **Classification Models** ‚Üí Predict property price ranges, buyer demographics, and market trends.  
‚úî **Neural Networks** ‚Üí Deep learning models for pattern recognition (e.g., feature engineering).  
‚úî **Kohonen Maps** ‚Üí Self-organizing maps for **clustering neighborhoods** based on sales behavior.  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ DAG-Based ML Pipeline** (Task Automation)  
‚úî Implement **Apache Airflow** or another DAG framework to define steps for data ingestion, transformation, and model training.  
‚úî Automate periodic **forecast updates** using DAG scheduling.  
‚úî Integrate **MLflow** logging for monitoring different model versions and optimizing hyperparameters.  

## **üìú Defining the Core Data Schema**
Since we are tracking **real estate transactions** across **historical time periods**, our dataset should be structured as follows:

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Fields**
| Field Name       | Type        | Description |
|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| `transaction_id` | `String`   | Unique identifier for each purchase |
| `date`          | `DateTime`  | Transaction timestamp (from 1900 to 2025) |
| `district`      | `String`    | One of Flower Hill's 7 districts |
| `property_type` | `String`    | Apartment, villa, commercial, park-related, historical property, etc. |
| `price`         | `Float`     | Transaction price in standard currency |
| `buyer_type`    | `String`    | Individual, corporation, developer, etc. |
| `seller_type`   | `String`    | Private owner, government, corporation |
| `square_meters` | `Float`     | Property size in m¬≤ |
| `condition`     | `String`    | New, renovated, needs repair, abandoned |
| `economic_status` | `String`  | City-wide economy marker (e.g., boom, recession) |
| `historical_significance` | `Boolean` | Whether the property has historical relevance |

### **üî• Database Design in MongoDB (PyMongo)**
MongoDB is great for **handling time-series data** and **unstructured real estate transactions** dynamically.

üí° **Collection: `transactions`**
```python
{
    "_id": "TXN10001234",
    "date": "1999-07-15T00:00:00",
    "district": "Costal",
    "property_type": "Luxury Villa",
    "price": 2_500_000.00,
    "buyer_type": "Individual",
    "seller_type": "Developer",
    "square_meters": 450.0,
    "condition": "New",
    "economic_status": "Boom",
    "historical_significance": false
}
```

## üöÄ Results  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **üìà Districts with Continuous Price Growth**  
   - If certain districts show **a steady upward trend**, they are **booming areas** with strong investment potential.  
   - For example, **Technica** (if present) might have **high-tech development**, boosting property value.  
   - This could suggest **strong demand, ongoing development projects, or corporate investments.**  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **üîÑ Districts with Cyclical or Fluctuating Prices**  
   - If some districts display **price surges followed by declines**, these areas might experience **short-term investment bursts** but lack sustained growth.  
   - Economic phases like **Boom ‚Üí Recession ‚Üí Recovery** might be influencing price fluctuations.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **üìâ Declining Price Trends**  
   - If districts like **Costal or Academia** (for example) show **continuous price drops**, it could indicate:  
     ‚úî **Economic downturns affecting real estate**  
     ‚úî **Infrastructure decline or migration to high-growth areas**  
     ‚úî **Regulatory changes impacting housing demand**  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **üìå Economic Status Correlations**  
   - If we overlay **economic status (Boom, Stable, Recession)** on the price graph, we might observe:  
     ‚úî **Boom periods aligning with price increases**  
     ‚úî **Recession periods causing noticeable downturns**
   
5Ô∏è‚É£ **üìä Comparative Price Analysis (Box Plot)**
‚úî **Faunarium district's real estate prices** appear **higher** than many other districts.  
‚úî **Median price** in Faunarium seems to hover around **6,000,000**, with a **range spanning 4,000,000‚Äì8,000,000**.  
‚úî **Outlier properties** show that prices can **reach 10,000,000**, indicating the presence of **high-value real estate**.  
‚úî The **wider price distribution** suggests that **environmental factors, such as parks and lakes, might increase property value variability**.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **üìâ Feature Importance (Bar Chart)**
‚úî **Historical significance negatively impacts real estate value**‚Äîsuggesting that older properties **might not hold as much modern appeal** despite their legacy.  
‚úî **Square meters have an even stronger negative correlation**, indicating that **larger properties tend to be priced lower on a per-unit basis**‚Äîpossibly due to land-use zoning restrictions or lower demand for oversized housing.  
‚úî This suggests that **proximity to parks and lakes alone might not be the main driver of price increases**, but rather **other factors like district reputation, demand, and infrastructure could be playing a role**.
‚úî While **Faunarium does show elevated property prices**, historical significance and size seem to be **strong limiting factors** on overall price appreciation.  
‚úî **Additional analysis** incorporating **park adjacency, lake views, or green space ratings** might further clarify **the precise environmental impact**.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **üìä Interpretation of the Box Plot (Faunarium vs. Other Districts)**  

Median real estate price is approximately 6,000,000, meaning properties in Faunarium tend to be higher-valued than many other districts.

Wide price variation suggests diverse pricing models across the district‚Äîpossibly due to environmental influence or infrastructure.

Outlier properties reaching 10,000,000 indicate a premium market segment, likely influenced by location desirability.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **üìà Interpretation of Feature Impact (Historical Significance & Size)**  

‚úî Historical significance has a slightly negative impact on property prices, implying modern properties may hold greater appeal in the market.

‚úî Square meters have a stronger negative correlation with prices, suggesting larger properties don‚Äôt necessarily mean higher value per unit.

9Ô∏è‚É£ **üöÄ Relevance to Tech Investment & Real Estate Growth**  

‚úî If historical significance negatively impacts real estate, it suggests that innovation hubs like Technica might attract higher property valuations due to modern infrastructure, startups, and advanced technology clusters.

‚úî The correlation between district type and pricing trends could help determine whether technology investment supports urban appreciation, much like how environmental factors influenced Faunarium‚Äôs pricing trends. 

10Ô∏è‚É£ **Real Estate Price Variability (Box Plot ‚Äì Faunarium vs. Other Districts)**
‚úî **Wide Price Range:** The real estate prices in Faunarium have a **broad distribution**, suggesting that external economic cycles could be influencing market fluctuations.  
‚úî **Higher Median Prices:** The median price sits around **6,000,000**, indicating **strong market valuation despite economic variations**.  
‚úî **Presence of High-Value Outliers:** Prices reaching **10,000,000** suggest **some properties maintain premium value** even during downturns.  

üìå **Implication:** Flower Hill's real estate **might exhibit resilience**, with some properties retaining high valuation regardless of global economic cycles.

11Ô∏è‚É£ **Impact of Historical Significance & Size on Prices (Bar Chart)**
‚úî **Historical Significance Negatively Impacts Prices:** Older properties **may not hold their value** during financial crises, hinting at **market preference for modern investments**.  
‚úî **Square Meters Have a Stronger Negative Effect:** Larger properties tend to **lose more value**, possibly due to **higher maintenance costs or reduced liquidity in economic downturns**.  

üìå **Implication:** During recessions, buyers might **prefer smaller, modern properties** with **lower upkeep costs**, aligning with **economic shifts influencing investment behaviors**.

12Ô∏è‚É£ **üöÄ Final Takeaway**
‚úî **Market Resilience:** Some districts (**like Faunarium**) appear **more resistant** to downturns, maintaining **high-value properties despite financial crises**.  
‚úî **Investment Shifts in Economic Cycles:** Buyers may **move away from historical properties** and focus on **modern, efficient real estate** during downturns.  
‚úî **Economic Influence on Property Size Preference:** Larger homes **lose more value**, suggesting a **trend toward compact, cost-efficient housing** when financial uncertainty is high.  

## üìà Future Improvements  
‚úî **Future improvements may involve the following aspects**:

1. Enhance MLflow tracking by **storing visualizations & comparative results**. 

2. Deploy **Airflow DAGs on a cloud-based solution** (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability.

3. Optimize processing speed using GPU acceleration.

4. We can extend the MLflow-Airflow setup by adding custom dependencies or modifying task execution orders.
